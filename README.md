### Snapshot
- Director of AI-Powered Onboarding, **Gen AI Global** — built the agent-assisted intake, screening, and role-placement system across 13+ departments.
- Focus: **Cognitive Security**, **AI Governance**, and **human-in-the-loop** ops for trustworthy AI programs.
- M.S. **Data Analytics & Computational Social Science** (UMass). Dual B.A. **Anthropology** + **Political Science**.

### What I’m Building Now
- **AI 2027 Data Layer**: governance patterns, data contracts, and audit trails for agent ecosystems.
- **Agent-delivered “AI Book”**: a dynamic learning agent that adapts content by language, role, and learning style to teach GenAI use cases.
- **Community Systems**: Discord-based contributor pipelines that translate interest → vetted skills → shipped outcomes.

### Selected Projects
| Project | Stack | What to look at |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent-Assisted Onboarding** | Python, FastAPI, automations, Airtable/Forms | Workflow logic, scoring rubrics, and audit logs for fairness and traceability. |
| **Cognitive-Security Playbooks** | Jupyter, Pandas, policy specs | Threat models for influence, detection heuristics, and red/blue evaluation scripts. |
| **Data-Layer Governance** | YAML contracts, JSON Schema | Versioned data contracts, lineage notes, change-control checklists. |
| **Open Learning “AI Book”** | Prompt graphs, LLM tools, docs | Adaptive content routing by learning goals; Q&A with citations. |

> Repos are being standardized. Ask for demo links if something is private or mid-refactor.

### Impact Highlights
- Scaled from ad-hoc recruiting to a **repeatable, measurable** onboarding pipeline with role mapping and contributor retention metrics.
- Cut cycle time from first contact to productive contribution using **agent prompts**, **rubrics**, and **self-serve** documentation.
- Drove cross-department alignment by shipping **clear interfaces**: inputs, outputs, SLAs, and reviewer checklists.

### Research & Interests
- **Cognitive Security**: narrative attack surfaces, susceptibility modeling, intervention ethics.
- **AI Governance**: documentation that auditors and operators both use; evaluation beyond accuracy.
- **Human Systems**: community design, motivation, and equitable pathways into AI work.

### Skills
- **Data/ML**: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, SQL
- **Product/Ops**: roadmap facilitation, metrics, A/B evaluation, documentation systems
- **Governance**: data contracts, review boards, risk registers, incident postmortems
- **Comms**: technical writing, stakeholder decks, onboarding and SOPs

### Talks & Media
- Building audit-ready contributor pipelines for open AI programs.
- Cognitive-security basics for non-specialists: how narratives move and how to measure lift.
- Agent-delivered learning: why “books” should be interactive systems.
