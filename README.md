### One-line
Builder of audit-ready AI programs that move from idea → talent → shipped outcomes. Multilingual. Social-science trained. Technically fluent.

### My Edge (why me)
- **Translate across worlds:** Anthropology + political science + **M.S. DACSS** + **Env Sci minor** → governance and human factors few devs carry.
- **Ship systems, not slides:** Designed an AI-assisted onboarding OS that scaled **200+ contributors across 13 teams**, cut manual ops **~70%**, and promoted interns to leads.
- **Security mindset:** Cognitive-security playbooks, data-contract patterns, and audit trails built into workflows from day one.
- **Teach at the boundary:** Led **Agent Development for non-coders** at Gen AI Global and universities; host of **AnthroHub** Season 1.

### MIT-Relevant Work
- **Web Dev (1 of 4 core devs), Gen AI Global** — internal dashboards, role-placement logic, contributor telemetry, and governance docs.
- **JobGen (Co-lead with founder)** — matching engine for applicants and posting orgs; product spec, risk register, review checklists.
- **Agent-Delivered “AI Book”** — adaptive agent that teaches GenAI use cases; content graph, multilingual delivery, eval gates.
- **Cognitive-Security Kits** — narrative threat models, red/blue evals, and safety checklists for agent deployments.

### Cross-Sector Impact
- **300for300 (Research Analyst):** youth mental-health evidence base; culturally responsive interventions and program metrics.
- **Tourism Startup CMO (Boston):** launched TikTok/YouTube/FB, multilingual SEO, creator team; analytics-driven recruiting.
- **Human Health Lab + Curation Center (1 year):** research operations and collections; disciplined documentation habits.

### What I Build
- Human-in-the-loop pipelines with measurable SLAs
- Data contracts, lineage notes, incident reviews
- Evaluation plans that mix statistical rigor with user reality

### Stack
**Python, Pandas, SQL, FastAPI, Jupyter, JSON/YAML, prompt/program design**  
**Ops/Gov:** role taxonomies, rubrics, audit trails, risk registers, change control  
**Growth:** SEO/SEM, analytics, partnerships  
**Languages:** English • French • Arabic (conversational)

### Teaching & Outreach
- Agent Dev workshops for non-coders; university guest sessions on governance and metrics
- AnthroHub podcast: culture × tech × systems

### Training
- **MIT Professional Education — Applied Data Science & AI (in progress)**
- **M.S. Data Analytics & Computational Social Science (UMass Amherst)**  
- **B.A. Anthropology** + **B.A. Political Science** • **Minor: Environmental Science**
